# Crystal Collector Game

A number matching game where you attempt to match your score to the randomly generated number.  

## Description

The player attempts to match the random number above the crystals in the green box. If the player matches the number, their win score will go up by 1. If the player does not match the number, their losses score will go up by one. When the player either wins or loses, the game will begin again with a new randomly generated number in the green box, as well as new numbers assigned to each crystal.
